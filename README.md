# Shockwave

A focus bracelet that shocks you.

In a world increasingly dependent on technology and constant mental simulation, it can be challenging to stay focused on the task at hand. With constant notifications and endless scrolling, many people, especially students, need a signal to not get distracted! Shockwave is a hardware and software bundle that includes the Shockwave Shocking Bracelet and the Shockwave Productivity App for iOS. The function of this project is a productivity app which uses physical stimulation to keep users focused. Normal usage may be similar to the following: the user starts a focus session of half an hour in the app and puts on the bracelet. If the user picks up the phone during this session, the Shockwave Bracelet will deliver a shock, reminding the user to stay focused. Once the session concludes, the bracelet will no longer deliver shocks, and the user can use the phone as usual.
